Question Chapter 5 Exercise 1.
#Use a dictionary to store information about a person you know.Store their first name, last name, age, and the city in which they live. You
#should have keys such as first_name, last_name, age, and city. Print each piece of information stored in your dictionary.

   
Explanation:
#In this example, we've created a dictionary called person_info with keys like
#"first_name," "last_name," "age," and "city." Then, we print each piece of information stored in the dictionary using the corresponding keys.
#You can replace the values with the actual information about the person you know.
